    <h1>Public Urged to Take Care as Wildfire Risk Remains Elevated</h1>
    <div class="meta">West of Ireland · 2025-10-29 · Fire Service</div>
    <p>Fire services in western counties have appealed to the public to take care outdoors due to an elevated risk of gorse, grass and forest fires.</p>
    <p>The warning follows an extended spell of dry weather during which crews have responded to a number of vegetation fires in rural areas.</p>
    <p>Local authorities are asking people not to burn waste or scrub and to avoid lighting open fires or barbecues in or near forested and bogland areas.</p>
    <p>The Department of Agriculture has reminded landowners that unlawful burning may result in penalties, including the possible loss of certain payments under rural support schemes.</p>
    <p>Members of the public who see signs of smoke or fire are advised to contact emergency services immediately via 999 or 112 and not to attempt to tackle large or fast-moving fires themselves.</p>

    <h3>Further information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Details may be updated as additional information is confirmed by official sources.</li>
      <li>Members of the public with relevant information are encouraged to contact the appropriate authorities.</li>
      <li>For emergencies, always dial 999 or 112.</li>
