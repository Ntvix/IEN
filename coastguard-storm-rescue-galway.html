    <h1>Four Fishermen Rescued After Vessel Loses Power Off Galway Coast</h1>
    <div class="meta">Off the Galway Coast · 2025-11-02 · Coast Guard</div>
    <p>The Irish Coast Guard has confirmed that four crew members from a fishing vessel have been rescued after their boat experienced engine failure in challenging sea conditions off the Galway coast.</p>
    <p>A mayday call was received shortly after midnight on Sunday 2 November, reporting that a vessel had lost power and was drifting in heavy swells. A Coast Guard helicopter and an RNLI all-weather lifeboat were immediately tasked to the scene.</p>
    <p>After several manoeuvres, the helicopter crew successfully winched the four fishermen from the deck of the vessel, which was rolling heavily in the swell.</p>
    <p>The rescued crew were transported to University Hospital Galway for assessment and were reported to be in stable condition.</p>
    <p>The vessel later sank and an assessment of the area was carried out. No pollution has been reported. The Coast Guard has reminded vessel operators to ensure that safety and communication equipment is in good working order before going to sea.</p>
