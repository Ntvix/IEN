    <h1>Air Ambulance Responds to Serious Cycling Incident in Wicklow Mountains</h1>
    <div class="meta">Sally Gap, Co Wicklow · 2025-11-07 · Ambulance</div>
    <p>The National Ambulance Service (NAS) has confirmed that its Helicopter Emergency Medical Service attended the scene of a serious cycling incident in the Wicklow Mountains on Friday 7 November.</p>
    <p>Due to the remote location and limited vehicle access, the air ambulance was tasked alongside ground units and local mountain rescue volunteers. Weather conditions were clear, which assisted both search teams and the helicopter crew in reaching the area.</p>
    <p>On arrival, paramedics and an emergency medicine doctor assessed a male cyclist who had sustained multiple suspected fractures and a head injury. He was stabilised at the scene, placed in a specialist stretcher and airlifted to St Vincent’s University Hospital for further treatment.</p>
    <p>In a statement, NAS acknowledged the support of mountain rescue organisations and members of the public who remained with the casualty prior to the arrival of emergency responders. The service also reminded outdoor enthusiasts to carry a fully charged phone, navigation aids and suitable clothing.</p>
    <p>The incident is not being treated as suspicious. No other injuries were reported.</p>
