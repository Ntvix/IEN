    <h1>Man in His 30s Found Dead Outside Residential Property in Dundalk</h1>
    <div class="meta">Dundalk, Co Louth · 2025-11-10 · Gardaí</div>
    <p>Gardaí in Dundalk have opened an investigation following the discovery of a man in his 30s outside a residential property in the Dúiche Roden area of Dundalk, Co Louth. The alarm was raised shortly after 8 a.m. on Monday morning when emergency services were called to the scene.</p>
    <p>The man was found unresponsive on the ground outside the property. Paramedics from the National Ambulance Service attended and carried out medical assessments; however, he was pronounced dead a short time later.</p>
    <p>The area was quickly sealed off by Gardaí to allow for a full technical examination. Scenes of crime officers attended and a post-mortem examination will be arranged to determine the cause of death. The results of the post-mortem will guide the direction of the Garda investigation.</p>
    <p>Local residents reported a visible Garda presence in the estate throughout the morning, with patrol cars and marked tape in place as officers spoke to potential witnesses and carried out door-to-door enquiries.</p>
    <p>Gardaí have appealed to anyone who may have been in the Dúiche Roden area between midnight and 8 a.m., and who may have seen anything unusual, to contact Dundalk Garda Station, the Garda Confidential Line or any Garda station. At this stage, no further details are being released pending notification of next of kin.</p>
