    <h1>Ambulance Delays Reflect Pressure on Emergency Departments</h1>
    <div class="meta">Ireland · 2025-11-05 · Ambulance</div>
    <p>Health authorities and ambulance representatives have acknowledged that sustained demand in emergency departments is contributing to delays in ambulance turnaround times at several hospitals nationwide.</p>
    <p>In recent weeks, there have been instances where ambulance crews remained with patients for prolonged periods while waiting for treatment spaces to become available. These delays can temporarily reduce the number of vehicles available to respond to new emergency calls in the community.</p>
    <p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) says measures such as additional surge capacity, step-down options and increased access to community and primary care services are being used in an effort to ease congestion.</p>
    <p>Patient advocacy groups have called for a long-term strategy to address overcrowding and ensure that both hospital and pre-hospital services are adequately resourced, particularly during seasonal peaks in demand.</p>
    <p>Members of the public are being reminded to use emergency services only in cases of genuine emergency and to consider GP, out-of-hours and minor injury services where appropriate.</p>
