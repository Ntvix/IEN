    <div class="meta">Cootehill, Co Cavan · 2025-11-09 · Gardaí</div>
    <p>Gardaí in Cavan have confirmed that a 15-year-old girl reported missing from the Cootehill area has been located safe and well. The teenager had last been seen on Thursday afternoon, prompting a missing person appeal and a coordinated search over a number of days.</p>
    <p>Search efforts were supported by Garda units from neighbouring divisions, the Garda Air Support Unit, Civil Defence, local mountain rescue volunteers and members of the wider community. Areas of open countryside, forest tracks and local watercourses were checked systematically.</p>
    <p>Shortly after 11 a.m. on Sunday, the girl was located by a volunteer search team in a wooded area several kilometres from her home address. She received immediate assistance at the scene before being taken to hospital as a precaution. Her family has been informed and are receiving support.</p>
    <p>In an update issued this afternoon, Gardaí expressed appreciation to everyone who shared the missing person appeal and to all who assisted with searches on the ground. They also reminded the public that if there are concerns for the welfare of any person, contact should be made with Gardaí without delay.</p>
    <p>As the teenager has now been found, Gardaí have asked that her privacy and that of her family be respected. No further details are being released at this time.</p>
