    <h1>Armed Gardaí Carry Out Major Operation Targeting Organised Crime in North Dublin</h1>
    <div class="meta">Ballymun, Dublin · 2025-11-10 · Gardaí</div>
    <p>An Garda Síochána has confirmed that a significant policing operation was carried out in the Ballymun area of north Dublin in the early hours of Monday 10 November. The operation formed part of an ongoing investigation into serious organised crime, including the sale and supply of controlled drugs and suspected firearms offences.</p>
    <p>Planned searches were conducted at a number of residential and commercial properties under warrant. The operation involved uniformed Gardaí, local detectives, members of the Armed Support Unit and the National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. A cordon was put in place in parts of the locality while the searches were underway.</p>
    <p>During the course of the operation, Gardaí seized a quantity of suspected cocaine, a significant sum of cash, encrypted communication devices and documentation believed to be linked to criminal activity. All items will now be sent for forensic and technical examination.</p>
    <p>Three men, aged in their 20s, 30s and 40s, were arrested at separate locations on suspicion of offences contrary to the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act and the Firearms Act. They are currently detained at Garda stations in the Dublin Metropolitan Region under the provisions of section 50 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007.</p>
    <p>In a statement, Garda management said that today’s searches demonstrate the organisation’s ongoing commitment to disrupting serious criminal networks operating in Irish communities. Further investigative enquiries are ongoing and additional arrests have not been ruled out.</p>
