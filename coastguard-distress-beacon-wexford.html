    <h1>Search Launched After Distress Beacon Detected Off Wexford Coast</h1>
    <div class="meta">Off the Wexford Coast · 2025-11-01 · Coast Guard</div>
    <p>A search operation was launched after an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) signal was detected off the Wexford coast on Saturday 1 November.</p>
    <p>RNLI lifeboats from several stations were launched and a fixed-wing aircraft provided by the Air Corps conducted an aerial search of the indicated area.</p>
    <p>Despite an extensive search over a wide area, no vessel or debris was located. The signal ceased after a period of time, and further analysis is being carried out to establish the exact source.</p>
    <p>The Coast Guard has stated that all alerts of this nature are treated as genuine until a satisfactory explanation is found.</p>
    <p>Mariners are reminded to ensure that safety equipment, including EPIRBs and personal locator beacons, is correctly registered and maintained.</p>
