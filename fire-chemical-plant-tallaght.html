    <h1>Investigation After Industrial Fire at Facility Near Tallaght</h1>
    <div class="meta">Tallaght, Dublin · 2025-11-03 · Fire Service</div>
    <p>Dublin Fire Brigade has brought a large industrial fire under control following an incident at a chemical processing facility near Tallaght in the early hours of Monday 3 November.</p>
    <p>Multiple fire appliances, including water tankers and a hazardous materials unit, attended the scene. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus worked to contain the blaze and prevent it from spreading to adjoining structures.</p>
    <p>As a precaution, a public information notice was issued advising residents in nearby areas to remain indoors and keep windows closed while smoke was visible. Environmental monitoring was carried out and authorities have since confirmed that air quality has returned to normal levels.</p>
    <p>Three firefighters were assessed for minor injuries and smoke inhalation and were later discharged. No injuries were reported among staff at the facility, who evacuated safely in line with the site’s emergency procedures.</p>
    <p>A joint investigation is now underway to establish the cause of the fire and to review any implications for safety protocols.</p>
